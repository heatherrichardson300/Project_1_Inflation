# Global Inflation Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing global inflation trends by examining key economic indicators across various sectors, including the Producer Price Index (PPI), Consumer Price Index (CPI), energy, and food prices. Using publicly available data, the analysis highlights inflationary pressures in different regions and provides insights into sector-specific trends.

In addition, data visualizations have been created to present this complex data in an easily digestible format, allowing users to explore patterns, trends, and correlations across sectors and time period.

Key research questions in the analysis include:

- **Energy**: *How have global energy prices shifted over the past few decades in relation to inflation rates? How has the transition to renewable energy sources impacted inflation compared to traditional fossil fuels?*
- **Consumption**: *Is CPI independent of other areas of inflation? What are the correlations between outliers in consumer products and overall inflation?*
- **Production**: *Which years experienced the most significant increases/decreases in PPI? How does the U.S. individual inflation compare to the global changes?*
- **Food**: *Which countries have experienced the highest and lowest rates of food inflation over time? Which countries experienced fewer spikes in food inflation compared to the significant ones (outliers)?*
- **Macro-Correlation between Sectors**: *What is the correlation between food price inflation and energy price inflation? What is the impact on consumer budget allocation?*
