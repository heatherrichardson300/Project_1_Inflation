Does the Global Inflation Rate of the Past few decades (1990-2022) Correlate to Renewable Energy Production?

General Analysis:
Looking for trends - spikes, acceleration/deceleration, deflation, as well
as general summary statistics on a macrolevel.

1.How have global energy prices shifted over the past few decades in relation to inflation rates?
Breakdown:
    1.read in the data set
    2.turn dataset into a dataframe for manipulation
    3.clean and filter data set
    4.call and store data from api in a seperate dataframe, then merge the two for analysis.
    5.generate summary statistics, and a few visualizations for trends.

2.How has the transition to renewable energy sources impact inflation compared to traditional fossil fuels?

Here I will cross examine global inflation rates from 1990-2022 and its possible correlation to global energy trends, with the
sustainable energy generation demands and rise on a specific developing country: the Dominican Republic
Breakdown:
    1.read in the data set/access api via api_key 
    2.turn dataset into a dataframe for manipulation
    3.clean and filter data sets
    4.call and store data from api in a seperate dataframe, then merge the three for analysis.
    5.generate summary statistics, and a few visualizations for trends.
